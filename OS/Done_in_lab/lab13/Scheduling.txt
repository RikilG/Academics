CPU CONTROL
lscpu	- details of cpu
cd /sys/devices/system/cpu - each folder for cpu core
cd cpu1
cat online
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > cpu1/online'
	disable each cpu and run your threads program
nproc	- check no of cpu's active


SCHEDULING ON LINUX

CFS - equally allocates time to all processes irrespective of its cpu usage. uses red black tree.

Schedulers on linux
SCHED_OTHER / SCHED_NORMAL
SCHED_FIFO
SCHED_RR
SCHED_BATCH			- used for cpu intensive tasks	- like neural network training
SCHED_IDLE			- for io intensive tasks - like word processing

TOP COMMAND
PR	- priority num
Ni	- nice number ( -20 to 19)(most to least favorable)(man nice)
	renice running process = sudo renice -n -20 -p <pid>
	run process with custom nice = sudo nice -n -10 file.out
	weight = (1024/1.25^nice)
nice value is static, priority is dynamic
	get scheduler and static pr = chrt -p 3179
	chrt = change realtime
	chrt -m = show min and max pr vaues for each scheduler

CHANGE SCHEDULER

sudo chrt -b -p 0 3179 = change sch to batch
